# Overview

What are my goals for the analysis? Show the business value proposition canvas for convenience of readers.

The code block below documents the list of R packages that I used in this project. For convenience, I used the package manager *Pacman* since it allows the installation and loading of all necessary packages in one step.

```{r}
if(require(pacman)==FALSE)
  install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(dplyr, DataExplorer, corrplot, leaps, skimr)
```

# Data Description
> Complete description of the data

```{r}
tan99 = read.csv("Data/BeachTan.csv")
skim(tan99)
```

What information was included in the data

# Preprocessing
> Details on data preprocessing are provided

# Conclusion
> A meaningful discussion of conclusions is included. The conclusion addresses the Business Value Proposition Canvas, and discusses how the solution meets the requirements of the customer segment.
