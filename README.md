# ISA616 Project

> Joshua Ferris, Fall 2020

## Project Outline

Beach Tan Inc. is one of the nation's largest franchisers of tanning salons. The data set I received from the client contains data for 10 locations in 2014. From the data provided, I decided to model the retail revenue a customer generates when purchasing various skin care lotions and products that Beach Tan offers in their stores. Using linear regression I was able to create a model allowing the interpretation of what factors can increase retail revenue for Beach Tan. This was done to align with the business value proposition canvas I created for the client, shown below.
